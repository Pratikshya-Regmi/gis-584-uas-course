### Software

- [GRASS GIS 7.8.5](http://grass.osgeo.org/) (you can use [these instructions to install it](http://ncsu-geoforall-lab.github.io/geospatial-modeling-course/logistics.html#software))
- Agisoft Metashape (provided at NCSU) - you can work on the demo version; installation files for Windows, Linux and Mac are available [on Agisoft website](http://www.agisoft.com/downloads/installer/).

Other resources:

- Processed data:
  - [Mid Pines dataset (formatted as GRASS location): LakeWheeler_NCspm](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1AfQGDB8tPXNXVpOEdyejlpbEE) with timeseries of DSMs from 2015 flights

    - [Point clouds for the gully area at Midpines](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1AfQGDB8tPXSDdSZGpJSktXM3c) (high density, from 2015 flights)

#### Lidar data

- [Classified lidar point cloud in LAS format for Mid_Pines](http://fatra.cnr.ncsu.edu/uav-lidar-analytics-course/mid_pines_spm_2013.las)
- [Secref and Mid Pines interpolated DEM/DSM (use r.unpack)](http://fatra.cnr.ncsu.edu/uav-lidar-analytics-course/secref_mid_pines_spm_elev.zip)

#### Orthophotography

- [Orthophotos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1AfQGDB8tPXd05tSTVLZUZBd00) as GRASS GIS packed rasters, use r.unpack from within the LakeWheeler_NCspm location to import them, run it with -o to override projection (it is just a different EPSG for HARN versus NAD83 datum, the difference is negligible)
